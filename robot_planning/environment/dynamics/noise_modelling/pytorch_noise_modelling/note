1. VAE can be used to model additive noise, including bias, and covariance of the noise term.
2. Theoretically, it is possible to model the nominal dynamics together with the additive noise with a VAE, however, because VAE
also has the property to "denoise" noisy data, it can be practically difficult to do this. Perhaps we need more careful design of the
loss function etc.?
3. We can utilize this property of VAE to model the nominal dynamics by the collected noisy data. At the same time, we can try another
VAE to model the noise term.

4. Since the VAE can concatenate x,y and learn their relationship (e.g. the sine wave), we can let covariance of the injected disturbances be
dependent on x, and see if VAE can learn a state-dependent disturbance. Note that you may want to remove the sine wave, and use pure noise
to train the VAE, otherwise concatenate x, y for the input_data will make VAE learn the denoised sine wave.
